We are using the stratified K-fold method to ensure that splits or folds created are the same size and holds roughly the same proportions of the class labels.  This a leave one out approach for cross validation that ensures that each record in the original data set is used at least once in a Training set and at least once in a Test set.  The total error in this method is sum of all the runs of the data, in our case this would be five (5) runs.  While this is a computationally expensive way to split our data, it provides the way to test the models while working to prevent overfitting to a single Training set of data. \n",
