    "\n",
    "We will be using the confusion matrix and the accuracy score from the confusion matrix to evaluated the effectiveness of the models for Task 1: Classification of Garage/No Garage.  A confussion matrix shows the number of predictions and breaks them into True Positivies, False Positives, True Negatives and False Negatives.  The accuracy score is calculated by taking the number of correct preditions (True Positivies and True Negatves) divided by the total number of predictions.  This summarizes how well the model predicted classification of each instance in the Test data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Task 2: Predicting the Tax Value, we will be using the R-Squared measure to evaluate the models created as we predicting a continuous variable.  R-squared provides the measure of how closely the data fits to a regression line.  We believe this would provided the best evaluation metric for task two since we are using the data to predict exact values of homes and expect correlation between the different attributes of a property and its value.  \n",

    "We will be using a stratified K-fold cross validation with five (5) folds, which creates a Training/Test split of 80/20 for our data.  We are using the stratified K-fold method to ensure that splits or folds created are the same size and holds roughly the same proportions of the class labels.  This a leave one out approach for cross validation that ensures that each record in the original data set is used at least once in a Training set and at least once in a Test set.  The total error in this method is sum of all the runs of the data, in our case this would be five (5) runs.  While this is a computationally expensive way to split our data, it provides the way to test the models while working to prevent overfitting to a single Training set of data. \n",
