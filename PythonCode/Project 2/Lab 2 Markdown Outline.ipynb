    "We will be using the confusion matrix and the accuracy score from the confusion matrix to evaluated the effectiveness of the models for Task 1: Classification of Garage/No Garage.  A confussion matrix shows the number of predictions and breaks them into True Positivies, False Positives, True Negatives and False Negatives.  The accuracy score is calculated by taking the number of correct preditions (True Positivies and True Negatves) divided by the total number of predictions.  This summarizes how well the model predicted classification of each instance in the Test data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Task 2: Predicting the Tax Value, we will be using the R-Squared measure to evaluate the models created as we predicting a continuous variable.  R-squared provides the measure of how closely the data fits to a regression line.  We believe this would provided the best evaluation metric for task two since we are using the data to predict exact values of homes and expect correlation between the different attributes of a property and its value.  \n",

    "### Model and Evaluation Part 2: Method of Data Division\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a stratified K-fold cross validation with five (5) folds, which creates a Training/Test split of 80/20 for our data.  We are using the stratified K-fold method to ensure that splits or folds created are the same size and holds roughly the same proportions of the class labels.  This a leave one out approach for cross validation that ensures that each record in the original data set is used at least once in a Training set and at least once in a Test set.  The total error in this method is sum of all the runs of the data, in our case this would be five (5) runs.  While this is a computationally expensive way to split our data, it provides the way to test the models while working to prevent overfitting to a single Training set of data. \n",

    "**Looks like a different data split is used for Task two**\n",

    "### Modeling and Evaluation Part 3: Model Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: Classification of Garage/No Garage\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first task we are applying classficiation models to the data to predict the presence of a garage on the a property.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model 1A: Random Forrest Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model created for the purpose of the predicting if a property has a garage or not, is a random forrest classification model. A Random Forrest Classification model takes the predictions made by multiple independent decision trees.  In order to minimize the processing time of the model, the depth of decisions trees were limited to 50, this limits the number of decisions that are made in order to classify a property.  We use a Principal Compenent Analysis (PCA) within the model creation statement, limiting the possible compenents to 50.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the training and test set split in the k-fold process, predictions were made to using the model and resulted in an accuracy of 86.97%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model 1B: K Nearest Neighbors Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The Second Model was created using PCA and K Nearest Neighbors Classicifcation, limiting the PCA to 100 components and with the classification of a property based on the five (5) nearest neighbors of the property.  The accuracy of the K Nearest Neighbors Classification was 81.73%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model 1C: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classfication\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally for task 1 we used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifciation method.  We mainly focused on three parameters kernel type, gamma and a cost parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kernel type parameter allows you to choose from 4 different kernels. These different kernels allow for the model to do complex calculations for higher dimensional data on a much more efficient basis. We originally tried a linear kernel, which produced a larger amount of feedback once the regression was completed, most importantly we had access to data that helped in the creation of the graphs that were included above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gamma parameter helps with the overfitting. In general, the higher the value of gamma leads to models that tend to have high bias and low variance. We set the value of Gamma equal to auto, which produced very good results. Interesting enough in attempting to change the Gamma value we found that the amount of time it took to produce a model was increased significantly. After multiple attempts, we chose to keep the Gamma value as auto.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cost parameter is a penalty parameter that corresponds to an error term. The cost parameter also controls the influence of each individual vector, which helps with the tradeoff between the smooth decision boundary and classifying the training dataset. We found that by setting the cost to 1.0 the amount of time to complete the SVM model was almost 3 times higher than a lower cost of .05.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the final model was 82.16%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2: Predicting the Tax Value of property\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second task we performed is the predicting the tax value of a property.  For the second task we started by taking the data and running a Principal Compenent Analysis on the data.  We normalized the Tax Value using a Common Log and will be predicting the log Tax Value for each property.  We also removed the acutal Tax Value from the data set in order to prevent the models from predicting on a value that was a part of the calculation used to create the log Tax Value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model 2A: Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model created was done using a linear regression which takes the relationship of varailbes, the different Principal compentents, to determine which varaibles could best be used to predict the value of the response variable, log Tax Value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Can we get the equation for this?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-Squared value for this model was 0.589.  \n",
